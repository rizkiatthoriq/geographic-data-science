# About the Project
The marine and fisheries sector plays a vital role for the Indonesian population and holds significant potential to drive national economic growth. West Java Province possesses considerable fisheries potential that can be further developed. This study aims to map potential fishing zones in West Java using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and economic valuation methods. The variables utilized include Sea Surface Temperature (SST), Chlorophyll-a concentration, salinity, ocean currents, distance from coral reef areas, sea level height, and seafloor topography data. Geospatial analysis was conducted to identify optimal fishing zones, while machine learning techniques were applied to model the relationships between environmental indicators and fishing vessel locations. The resulting maps provide estimates of fish catch potential per unit area along with associated economic valuations, visualized through an interactive dashboard. This research supports sustainable fisheries resource management, enhances fishermen's income, and strengthens food security and the coastal economy in West Java. The implementation of this mapping approach also contributes to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) related to life below water, health, and nutrition. Collaborative efforts among government bodies, fishers, and all stakeholders in the fisheries sector are essential for translating this research-based policy into sustainable development outcomes in the marine and fisheries sector.

_This research project has successfully won one of the prestigious geospatial and statistics competitions in Indonesia, *JABAR GEORESTART (Jabar Geospatial Remote Sensing and Statistic Research Competition) 2024* under the theme of socioeconomic, which focuses on fishery yield_
